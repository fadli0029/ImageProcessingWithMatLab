# Image Processing With MATLAB

This project is from the Lab Assignment in my ECE 5 class, Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this project, I learned about **Digital Signal Processing**. Upon completing this assignment, I have a strong understanding on concepts like pixels.

One of the most valuable experiences from this project is being able to refine my skills in using MATLAB and its built-in functions. 

This project consists of 5 challenges and you can find the MATLAB files for each challenge in separate folders. For challenge 1A, go to challenge 1A folder for the MATLAB files; for challenge 2A, go to challenge 2A folder for the MATLAB files, and so on.
**Do not remove images in these challenge folders as the code in the MATLAB files specifies to these images. Unless you are using your own image, be sure to not delete these files.**

If you would like to look at the questions for this Lab Assignment to get an overview of each challenge, then navigate to the ECE 5 Final Lab2 Part2 file.

Below are screenshots of PowerPoint slides from this assignment as a method to measure studentsâ€™ understandings of the concepts tested in this Lab Assignment.
